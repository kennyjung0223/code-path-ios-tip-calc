Submitted by: Kenny Jung

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Dark Mode
* [x] Party Size to split bill

## Notes

Honestly... everything not part of the tutorial. I spent a lot of my time reading documentation, Stack Overflow, looking at other code and figuring out how it works. Out of the features, implementing the dark mode feature served the most challenging part for me. Now I have a much better understanding of how the View Controller Lifecycle works.
